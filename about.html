     <p class="para1"> Skateboarding is one of my biggest passions. Starting at an early age, I was clueless. I developed new capabilities as years went by. 13 years later I am now a private skateboard instructor located in Jacksonville, Florida. One of the unique things that I love about Skateboarding is that you have to keep practicing in order to be consistent and proper. In my opinion Skateboarding is about being creative and consistent.

     <p class="para4">When I'm not Teaching skateboard lessons or trouble shooting code, I like to DJ and listen to music. A peaceful way to escape reality and focus. </p>
